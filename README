This is the sandbox branch...

This is a fork of vitunes. Just a few minor tweaks that made this a little
more useful for me. Basically I added external input functionality so I
could control vitunes from other applications, and I modified the makefile
so it would compile properly on Mac OS X and Linux.

Summary of bugs fixed (from original upstream version):
   - memory leak fixed in str2argv
   - memory leak fixed in playlist_free
   - closed and unlinked socket when exiting
   - default playlist mode was being ignored in config.h and config file
